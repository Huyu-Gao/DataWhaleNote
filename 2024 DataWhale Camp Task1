The following note is used to record my views and experience in 2024 3rd DataWhale Camp for task1 in 2024.7.28
This is created to understand Baseline Project.

1.Use Related Libraries

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from pathlib import Path
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

2.Preprocessing Data
    This step makes the data more clear and convenient to deal.
    
    base_path = Path("data")  # 确保数据都放在同级的data目录下
    
    # 读取市场数据
    electricity_price = pd.read_csv(base_path / "electricity price.csv")
    # 读取市场主体（各发电机组）数据
    unit = pd.read_csv(base_path / "unit.csv")
    
    """
    准备示例提交数据sample_submit
    1. electricity_price["clearing price (CNY/MWh)"].isna()找到出清价格为缺失值的行，即要预测的目标
    2. 去除demand列，符合最后的提交格式 
    """
    
    sample_submit = electricity_price[electricity_price["clearing price (CNY/MWh)"].isna()].drop(columns="demand")//Target to predict
    sample_submit.to_csv(base_path / "sample_submit.csv", index=False)

3.Timestamp
    # 将day和time列合并成timestamp列，便于提取时间戳特征
    electricity_price["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(
        electricity_price["day"] + " " + electricity_price["time"].str.replace("24:00:00", "00:00"))//trans 2 list into timestamp
    
    # 处理24:00:00的情况，即表示第二天的00:00:00
    mask = electricity_price['timestamp'].dt.time == pd.Timestamp('00:00:00').time()
    
    # 需要将这些行的日期部分加一天
    electricity_price.loc[mask, 'timestamp'] += pd.Timedelta(days=1)
    
    # 设置列的顺序，同时去除day和time列
    electricity_price = electricity_price[["timestamp", "demand", "clearing price (CNY/MWh)"]]

4.ABM
    Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** is a computational method that simulates the complex behavior and dynamics of a system. 
    It models the individuals in the system (called "agents") and their interaction rules. Each agent has unique properties and behaviors. 
    The ABM model helps understand the behavior and evolution of complex systems by simulating the interactions between agents and observing macro-level patterns and phenomena.

5.Marginal cost pricing
    Each unit quotes its own cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, without considering market information and other unit information. 
    By analogy, it only sells goods at cost (in fact, this is the long-term equilibrium state of a perfectly competitive market)
    Then, the bids are sorted from low to high, and the bids are accepted in turn until the accumulated power exceeds the total demand and the market reaches a clearing state, 
    and the last satisfied bid is used as an estimate of the market clearing price.
